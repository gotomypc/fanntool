An artificial neural network (ANN), usually called "neural network" (NN), is a mathematical
model or computational model that tries to simulate the structure and/or functional aspects
of biological neural networks. An ANN performs a non-parametric non-linear multivariate
multiple regression.

The  Fast  Artificial  Neural  Network library (FANN)  is a free open source neural network
library, which implements multilayer artificial neural networks in C and supports both fully
and sparsely connected networks. Cross-platform execution in both fixed and floating point
is supported. It includes a framework for easy handling of training data sets. It is easy to
use, versatile, well documented, and fast. PHP, C++, .NET, Ada, Python, Delphi, Octave,
Ruby, Prolog Pure Data and Mathematica bindings are available.

FANNTool is a GUI to the FANN library which allows its easy usage without the need o
programming.



FANNTool is an **Open Source project** and so the users and the community are  important factor.
We appreciate every feedback, question, bug report, patches and of course donations.

**By donating money to FANNTool, you help us to continue to development of new versions**
